Possibilities & ideas
======================
First things first, we are well aware that the size of this island could well be a continent or a world map. |br|
For that particular matter we have entertained the possibilities of the following: |br|

**Freshwater landtype** for lakes or rivers: |br|
Fodder in fish for carnivores or alpha predators. Availability: Yes (Read swimming underneath) |br|
Nourishment/sustenance for carnivores, herbivores or alpha predators, in the sense of fresh water. |br|
**Swimming:** |br|
This will only work in freshwater, this paired with finding nourishment in fish etc makes perfect sense. |br|
**Volcano:** |br|
Set a random eruption "timer" on it, when it erupts it has a possibility of killing nearby creatures. |br|
Considering we have a working migration randomizer, we can modify this to fit the lava flow. |br|
Make sure to set a limit to the randomizer so we dont have the entire map full of lava which will kill everything. |br|
If the volcano is on an island near a continent for example, will it form new land after time? |br|
Will it create a pathway from the island to the continent if the distance isn't too far? Maybe, it is possible. |br|

**Alpha predator:** |br|
To keep it simple, a merge of the carni and herbi class, it can eat fodder, get nourishment from fresh water and |br|
killing animals, it hunts and eats herbivores and carnivores alike. Basically a early stage humanoid. |br|
Maybe it hunts specifically for species with a large abundancy as a regulator type thing..? |br|

**Terminator:** |br|
A terminator that migrates randomly and wipes out the entire cell regardless of species or creature. |br|
Rise of the machines... |br|

**Saltwater fish:** |br|
For this to work we need to frame the map with the 'Fence' so the fish is contained to the map. |br|
Yes Lars, i know... The fence has a practical meaning other than making a nice looking frame of the map... |br|
To make the food chain simple we can make fish that preys on other fish and fish that eats..lets say plankton. |br|
in simpler terms... HerbiFish and Carnifish(sharks). |br|
This would be a nifty addon if you for example created a world map or something.. |br|
